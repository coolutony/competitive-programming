### From Google Code Jam  
#### Round 1A 2019
* [Pylons](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam/round/0000000000051635)
    * Took enough time (>week) to solve the problem. 
    * The solution is uploaded as a folder with two scripts. One tests the solution for every possible input.  
    Another is the actual submission that was judged as correct.
* [Golf Gophers](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam/round/0000000000051635)
    * The solution was written while participating in the actual competition in 2019. 
* [Alien Rhyme](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam/round/0000000000051635)
    * The solution was written after reading the analysis of the problem and thus was mostly a practice of implementation.
#### Round 1B 2019
